Potential topic models we can use:

1. PLSA (probabilistic latent semantic analysis): One of the first topic models


--> We are using this <--
2. ***LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation): 
* Generalization of PLSA. Currently the most popular topic model. 
                                      
* Not the most effective in classifying tweets (perhaps due to the short doc length).
* Each doc is a prob distrib over topics, each topic is a prob distrib over words.
  
--> maybe use a heuristic to increase document size                                    

3. Pachinko Allocation:
* Improves LDA by also modeling correlations between different topics.

4. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):
* Uses a sliding window to go across documents
* This is an improvement because this does not look at each documents frequency 
while not having to aggregate documents to deal with short document length

5. Author-Topic Model:
* Like LDA but each document also takes into account the author
* Potentially involves aggregating a user's tweets into a larger document (we don't want this)

Mallet will be the LDA API
