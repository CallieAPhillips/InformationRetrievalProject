Potential topic models we can use:

1. PLSA (probabilistic latent semantic analysis): One of the first topic models


2. LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation): 
*Generalization of PLSA. Currently the most popular topic model. 
                                      
*Not the most effective in classifying tweets (perhaps due to the short doc length).
*Each doc is a prob distrib over topics, each topic is a prob distrib over words.
                                      

3. Pachinko Allocation:
*Improves LDA by also modeling correlations between different topics.
