Potential topic models we can use:

1. PLSA (probabilistic latent semantic analysis): One of the first topic models


2. LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation): 
* Generalization of PLSA. Currently the most popular topic model. 
                                      
* Not the most effective in classifying tweets (perhaps due to the short doc length).
* Each doc is a prob distrib over topics, each topic is a prob distrib over words.
                                      

3. Pachinko Allocation:
* Improves LDA by also modeling correlations between different topics.

4. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):
* Uses a sliding window to go across documents
* This is an improvement because this does not look at each documents frequency 
while not having to aggregate documents to deal with short document length
