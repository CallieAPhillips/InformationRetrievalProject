info retrieval project notes: 

*Tweets are short --> hard to decipher what topics it contains. 
One possible solution is to add synonyms of the key words in the tweet to increase the doc length and inflate the word's impact.


use hashtags for topics
train on popular hashtags, ok to go back and group different topics together
*manually label another hundred or so tweets with hashtags in the testing set so you can evaluate

*(search for paper "topic model twitter" for more info)
*look up other topic models (LDA did not perform that well)

*what if tweet doesn't have hashtags (harder, need huerisitic, how do you know it is accurate?) -->don't need to classify these
