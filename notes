info retrieval project notes: 
collect tweets --> follow established examples, start early
ML techniques --> cluser then classify? (Problem of how many clusters to establish)
                       --> LDA unsupervised topic modeling (any different than other research?)
How to define topics --> ???
*predict time of tweet based on topic?
short text --> hard --> add synonyms of important words
use hashtags for topics
train on popular hashtags, ok to go back and group different topics together
search for paper "topic model twitter"
look up other topic models (LDA did not perform that well)
what if tweet doesn't have hashtags (harder, need huerisitic, how do you know it is accurate?)
manually label another hundred or so tweets with hashtags in the testing set so you can evaluate
