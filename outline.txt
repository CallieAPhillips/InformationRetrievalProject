Tweet Classification Project Outline:

1. Gather a small set of very popular hashtags
2. Manually label each hashtag as a topic/classification (i.e. define 20 classifications to 100 different hashtags)
3. Gather a large set of tweets that contain a hashtag from the step 1.
4. Run the ParallelTopicModel in Mallet on the training set
5. From the lda topic model in step 5, gather the estimated topic distribution vector for each tweet

i.e. for tweet1, its estimated topic distribution might be
p( z | document = tweet1 ) = [ p(z=topic1 | document = tweet1), p(z=topic2 | document = tweet1), ... p(z=topicK | document = tweet1)]
where p(z|d) equals the probability of observing topic z given we are in document d

6. Concatenate each tweet's topic distribution vector with its bag-of-words vector (in our case the FeatureSequence object each Instance has) and its classification based on its hashtag

i.e. for tweet1, if its BoW representation is:
[0,4,1,0,2, ... 1] where term i in the number of occurences in the document of the ith word in the dictionary
then the concatenated vector for this tweet will be 
[ p(z=topic1 | document = tweet1), ... p(z=topicK | document = tweet1), 0, 4, 1, 0, 2, ... 1, "sports"] 
which is a feature vector of size K+V where K = # of topics, V = # of words in the dictionary

7. Stack the feature vector of each tweet on top of each other so that it forms a matrix, 
where each row of the matrix is the feature vector of a given tweet

8. Split the matrix into a training set and a testing set (perhaps a 90-10 split)
9. Run a machine learning classification algorithm (i.e. support vector machine, random forests) on this training matrix subset
10. Run the ML model from step 9 on the testing matrix subset (use the classification column in this set only to measure the prediction accuracy)
11. Return the final classification accuracy

Things to note:

* Must find a reasonable way to gather popular hashtags, and then gather a large set of tweets that only include these hashtags
* Process the tweets before the CSV file is constructed (mainly strip any commas from the tweet's content before writing to the file)
* Must decide on the appropriate number of topics to be estimated (this should probably be the number of labels we have at the end of step 2)
* Must decide on the appropriate ML algorithm to apply (and also a framework for ML algorithms, I believe Mallet may already have some)
(keep in mind that there is likely going to more features in the matrix than actual tweets, which maybe troublesome)
* For step 6, professor Wang suggested a TF-IDF bag-of-words representation will work better
